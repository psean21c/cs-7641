1. Download and unzip the entire folder 'HW2'.
2. For part 1, each optimization problem has its own python script - Four Peaks, Continuous Peaks and Flip Flop. Other problem examples are also presented in the 'extras' folder but are not used. Running each file will generate all the necessary plots used in the assignment.
3. For part 2, a separate script for neural network training does the same.
4. Data for part 2 is stored in the 'data' folder.
