To run the code, you will need the following packages in addition to Python 3.7 and jupyter:
numpy == 1.15.1
scipy == 1.1.0
scikit-learn == 0.19.2
pandas == 0.23.4
matplotlib == 2.2.3

1. Open a jupyter notebook instance, after downloading and unzipping the entire folder 'HW1'.
2. Each dataset has its dedicated notebook - Rice and Breast Cancer.
3. Both csv files are stored in the 'data' folder.
